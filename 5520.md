## RecycleView of Links

1. Add a "Link Collector" button to the main activity that brings up a new activity when tapped.

4. You design the best way to implement UI, but it must start with a floating action button click.

5. When the user taps a URL in the list, launch the URL in a web browser (use an intent, not android:autolink). __Think about what the other actions should do.__

6. Implement the deletion of an item in the list and the editing of an item in the list (edit the name and URL).  What should this UI look like?
